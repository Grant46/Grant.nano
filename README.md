- Heyyy i'm Grant ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
- I pretend to be a developer on C, C++, Python, Php, SQL..
- You desperate university student or banal living being take a look at the repositories, maybe they can come in handy for you

FOR DEV.

the code present in the repositories is extracted from exercises performed over the years, some of these codes are not very optimized.

I will try to keep the repositories updated with the most famous examples

N.B so maybe within this year you'll be programming 1 and 2
